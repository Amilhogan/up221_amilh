Course Description:
The goal for this course is to expose you to the foundations of spatial data science. Where once there was a dearth of available digital information, we now live in a world of too much data. How can these data be transformed into human expressions and narratives, and how can these be represented spatially? Our understanding of social phenomena through spatial constructs in urban data allows us to address location-based questions on social justice, the environment, transportation, community development and design, amongst many other themes, and how these factors may affect different population groups in different ways.

This course prepares you for challenges in urban data beyond off-the-shelf cartographic approaches. It looks at the various components of data’s journey—acquisition, exploration, modeling, and communication through visualization—and how it enables and advances your research from a data science perspective.

We begin with an introduction to various data science tools, and review the basics of programming with Python. Once a foundation of Python programming and data wrangling is achieved, spatial analysis through Python Libraries, and subsequently, through advanced geoprocessing will be introduced. All lessons will be based on “real” data with analytical methods addressing relevant and contemporary urban problems.

In addition to the programming lab sessions, you will be given weekly or bi-weekly "thinking cap" assignments, where you will be asked to think critically about contemporary urban issues. Be prepared to address various topics from the perspective of your own lived experiences, how it informs the topic, and what kind of research can advance knowledge in a positive way.

While there are no prerequisites for taking this course, people who are approaching programming for the first time will admittedly find the course to be intense and challenging.
